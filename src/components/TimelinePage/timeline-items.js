      "Scotiabank’s Digital Banking Unit in Waterloo consisted of a small,           yet tight-knit team of user experience designers and engineers. I           completed a 16-week internship and delivered a classified project           aiming to transform the future of banking by redefining the           relationship a customer has with their finances. My role involved           developing an app (full stack) in an agile team of engineers with a           test-driven, code review culture. Plus, I had the chance to be a part           of every step; from idea generation to the final delivery. Therefore,           I had to think strategically and go beyond my role in order to           implement the project stakeholders' feedbacks into our project. As the           project was completed end-to-end, our app will soon be available on           Google Play and App Store given that it is a seasonal product.",
